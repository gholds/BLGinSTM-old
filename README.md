# Bilayer Graphene in Tunneling Measurements

Bilayer graphene (BLG) is of great technological interest due to its dynamic band structure. By applying an electric field, a band gap opens changing bilayer graphene from a semimetal to a semiconductor. One method of probing the band structure of bilayer graphene is through tunneling measurements. However, when applying voltages to gates, an electric field is produced which changes the magnitude of the gap and the shape of the band structure in general. Therefore, the current from bilayer graphene is much more complicated than one may expect.

This is a package for analyzing bilayer graphene in tunneling measurements. It includes methods for calculating common quantities associated with solid state systems (band structure, density of states, etc.) as well as methods for analyzing the signal of bilayer graphene in a solid state system.
