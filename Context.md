Only a few papers have considered gated tunneling experiments of BLG. Fewer still have been performed in an STM.

For STM, the only papers we are aware of are from:

*  [Leroy](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/brian-leroy) group in [2009](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3275755)
* [Stroscio](https://www.nist.gov/people/joseph-stroscio) group in [2011](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nphys1988)

### Stroscio 2007



### Leroy 2009

​	They produced a plot of $dI/dV$ as a function of gate voltages.

#### Effects of Gates

This paper only takes into account the effect of the back gate and ignores the electric field produced by the tip.

They  claim the Dirac point is located at an energy
$$
E_D = \frac{\epsilon V_g}{2et_{ox}}\left( \frac{\hbar^2\pi\epsilon_0}{m^*} -d \right)
$$
where $V_g$ is the voltage of the back gate, $\epsilon$ is the relative permittivity of the oxide between the BLG and back gate, $t_{ox}$ is the thickness of that oxide, and $d$ is the distance between the layers of graphene.

Screening is taken into account by claiming that it causes the gap to close by a factor of 1.6. They reference McCann 2006 as an example.

### Stroscio 2011

### Veuillen 2012

This paper looked at both monolayer and bilayer graphene grown on SiC. This paper focused on pseudospin (sub-lattice symmetry) and looked at quasiparticle interference.

### Leroy 2014

The focus of this paper was to extract the band structure of bilayer graphene by using quasiparticle interference from scattering off of a bilayer/trilayer boundary (an example of Friedel oscillations).

They claim to be the first to probe the band structure with control of the electric field.

> This work provides the first direct probe of the full energy versus momentum dispersion of high-quality bilayer graphene as a function of electric field.

> This work represents the first direct local mapping of the band structure of bilayer graphene as a function of electric field.

# Model of BLG in an STM

Our model of BLG in an STM assumes the tip effectively acts as a parallel plate capacitor, so this model is applicable to other tunneling experiments as well.
